# Dessert Recipes
This app makes an API call to the end point https://themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Dessert to fetch a list of desserts and present them on a list with along with a thumbnail image. 
A user can then tap on the list item and another call to endpoint https://themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i=MEAL_ID where MEAL_ID is the id of the dessert.
Once the call has finished successfully, the user will be navigated to a list detail view which shows an image, ingredients list, instructions, and possibly a youtube video.
